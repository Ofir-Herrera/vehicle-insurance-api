## 💰 **Vehicle Value Calculation**

The vehicle market value is calculated using **linear depreciation** based on vehicle age.

### 📐 **Formula**

    value = max(0,BASE_VALUE - (age * DEPRECIATION_PER_YEAR))

### 🧠 **Explanation**
- A fixed amount is subtracted from the base value each year.
- The depreciation rate remains constant over time.
- Simple, transparent, and predictable valuation model.
